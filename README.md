## Usage example

### 1. Export rooms and room lists (on-prem)

```powershell
cd "C:\Dev\Rooms-RoomLists\1-Scripts"
.\1-Export-RoomsAndRoomLists_OnPrem.ps1
```
### 2. Build RoomsToMove.csv
Create Rooms_Migration\2-Out\RoomsToMove.csv with a single column:
```csv
EmailAddress
room1@contoso.com
room2@contoso.com
room3@contoso.com
```
### 3. Create a migration batch in Exchange Online
```powershell
cd "C:\Dev\Rooms-RoomLists\1-Scripts\1-Scripts"

.\2-New-RoomMigrationBatch_Exo.ps1 `
  -BatchName "Rooms-To-EXO-Wave1" `
  -SourceEndpoint "Hybrid-MigrationEndpointName" `
  -TargetDeliveryDomain "contoso.com" `
  -AutoStart
```
### 4. Create room lists in EXO from the export
```powershell
$include = @(
  "Head Office – Meeting Rooms",
  "Regional Office – Meeting Rooms"
)

.\3-New-ExoRoomLists_FromExport.ps1 `
  -IncludeRoomLists $include `
  -AliasSuffix "-EXO"
```
### 5. Generate an HTML / Word migration report
```powershell
.\4-New-RoomsAndRoomLists_MigrationReport.ps1 `
  -CustomerName "Your Organisation Name" `
  -ProjectName "Exchange Online Migration" `
  -ReportVersion "v1.0" `
  -GenerateWord
```
This produces an HTML report (and optional DOCX) under Rooms_Migration\2-Out.
